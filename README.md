# Welcome to Snake Editor!
## Hi! This is our repository, we are here to present our new project.

- Inspired by GNU Emacs, we created our new software. Which has the purpose of being an editor for Python code, we named it *Snake Editor*.

## Technologies used:

- Tkinter (Python Lib)
- Python 3.10
- GitHub Desktop (Git Version Control)

## Authors:
- [Kmsz](https://github.com/Kamaasoo)
- [Marcio Dantas](https://github.com/marc-dantas)

## Prerequisites for use (not yet recommended):
- If you're on a linux distribution, make sure IDLE is installed, if you are unsure run the command `sudo apt install idle-python3.9` in your terminal to get syntax highlighting to work. Same for MAC OS users.
- This program uses a specific font to be able to show the icons on the screen, if you don't have it installed on your system, the icons won't appear correctly, to download, click [here](https://github.com/marc-dantas/snake-editor/blob/main/app/resources/font/Aquawax-Pro-Pictograms-Regular.ttf?raw=true) to download it.
- If you're on Microsoft Windows, make sure your python installation includes the IDLE installation, to avoid syntax highlighting not working.
